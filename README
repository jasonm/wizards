== Wizards!: A Backbone.js example application

This is an example Backbone.js and Rails 3.1 application.
The name is inspired by a game of Wisest Wizard at RailsCamp New England 2011.

The application is scaffolded using https://github.com/codebrew/backbone-rails

It uses Faye http://faye.jcoglan.com/ to broadcast model updates to clients.
This notification is very early: it only notifies of update.

=== Running in development

You'll need to run a Faye server.  See Procfile for the command, or use
Heroku's foreman gem: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile
