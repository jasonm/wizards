## Wizards!: A Backbone.js example application

This is an example Backbone.js and Rails 3.1 application.
The name is inspired by a game of Wisest Wizard at RailsCamp New England 2011.

The application is scaffolded using https://github.com/codebrew/backbone-rails

It uses the backbone_sync-rails gem to broadcast model updates to clients.
